DANTE - A lexical database for English
==============================

Dante is a lexical database for English. It provides a fine-grained and comprehensive record of the behaviour of over 42,000 headwords and 23,000 multiword expressions, and includes over 27,000 idioms and phrases.

Dante is the product of a three-year lexicographic project, in which the core vocabulary of English was analysed from scratch, using a custom-built corpus of 1.7 billion words. It is a unique resource, providing a systematic description of the meanings, grammatical and collocational behaviour, and text-type characteristics of English words. Linguistic facts, drawn from the corpus, are recorded in over 40 datatypes, all machine-searchable. Every one of these is linked to a specific sense of the headword and supported by two or more unedited corpus examples.

Dante was designed by [Sue Atkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryl_Atkins), [Adam Kilgarriff](https://kilgarriff.co.uk/) and [Michael Rundell](https://michaelrundell.com) who led a team of 20 highly skilled lexicographers. The database was commissioned by [Foras na Gaeilge](https://www.forasnagaeilge.ie/) who as the sole copyright holder released Dante in 2024 under the [CC-BY license][cc-by].
